#Morseapperat
This is a simple morse tranciver, able to communicate over short (~100m) distances  that you can build yourself.

The legality of this relies on a technicality: the actual radio is not what you build, it is just an activator for it.

##Technically
This is just a simple astable multivibrator (jfgi) that will activate the transmitter, and allow the receiver to operate when it is not active.

The transciever set this is built up over is found at: http://www.dx.com/p/433mhz-rf-transmitter-receiver-link-kit-green-221225#.VWtIbeQxWny it is usually used for arduinos or the like.
